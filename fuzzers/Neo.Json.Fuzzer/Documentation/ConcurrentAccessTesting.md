# Concurrent Access Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the concurrent access testing strategy for the Neo.Json.Fuzzer. Thread safety and proper handling of concurrent operations are essential for a JSON library used in multi-threaded applications.

## Test Categories

### 1. Read Concurrency

- Multiple threads reading the same JSON object
- Concurrent traversal of large structures
- Concurrent JPath queries on shared objects
- Concurrent type conversions

### 2. Write Concurrency

- Multiple threads modifying different parts of a JSON structure
- Concurrent property addition/removal
- Concurrent array element manipulation
- Concurrent serialization operations

### 3. Mixed Read/Write Operations

- Some threads reading while others are writing
- Interleaved read/write operations
- Complex operation sequences that may cause race conditions
- Operations that may trigger internal restructuring

### 4. Stress Testing

- High thread count (32+ threads)
- Rapid operation sequences
- Long-running concurrent operations
- Memory pressure during concurrent operations

## Test Structure Generation

The fuzzer will generate JSON structures specifically designed to test concurrent access:

1. **Large, Deep Structures**: To maximize potential thread interaction
2. **Balanced Trees**: For predictable concurrent traversal
3. **Property-Heavy Objects**: For concurrent property access testing
4. **Large Arrays**: For concurrent index-based access

## Concurrency Patterns

1. **Reader-Heavy**: Many readers, few writers
2. **Writer-Heavy**: Many writers, few readers
3. **Balanced**: Equal number of readers and writers
4. **Phased**: Alternating between read-heavy and write-heavy phases
5. **Random**: Unpredictable mix of operations

## Coverage Goals

The concurrent access testing should aim to cover:

1. All major operations under concurrent conditions
2. Edge cases in concurrent modification
3. Performance degradation under contention
4. Deadlock and race condition detection
5. Memory consistency issues

## Implementation Approach

1. Create a multi-threaded test harness
2. Generate test cases with various concurrency patterns
3. Track thread interactions and operation outcomes
4. Identify any thread safety issues or performance bottlenecks
5. Measure throughput and latency under concurrent load

## Specific Test Scenarios

1. **Concurrent Parsing**: Multiple threads parsing different JSON strings
2. **Shared Structure Access**: Multiple threads accessing the same JSON structure
3. **Modification Races**: Threads competing to modify the same properties
4. **Serialization Under Load**: Concurrent serialization of shared structures
5. **Mixed Workload**: Realistic mix of operations mimicking application patterns

## Metrics to Collect

1. Operation throughput under concurrent load
2. Latency distribution for different operation types
3. Contention points and hot spots
4. Memory usage patterns during concurrent operations
5. Thread synchronization overhead
