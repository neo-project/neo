# Unicode Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive Unicode testing strategy for the Neo.Json.Fuzzer. Proper Unicode handling is critical for a JSON library as it ensures correct parsing, serialization, and manipulation of international text and special characters.

## Test Categories

### 1. String Encoding and Decoding

- **UTF-8 Encoding/Decoding**: Testing proper handling of UTF-8 encoded strings
- **UTF-16 Surrogate Pairs**: Testing proper handling of UTF-16 surrogate pairs
- **Escape Sequences**: Testing \uXXXX and \uXXXX\uXXXX escape sequences
- **Invalid Sequences**: Testing handling of invalid UTF-8 and UTF-16 sequences

### 2. Character Classes

- **Control Characters**: Testing handling of control characters (U+0000 to U+001F)
- **Whitespace Characters**: Testing various Unicode whitespace characters
- **Special Characters**: Testing characters with special meaning in JSON (quotes, backslashes)
- **Combining Characters**: Testing characters that combine with preceding characters

### 3. Unicode Planes

#### Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, U+0000 to U+FFFF)

- ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F)
- Latin-1 Supplement (U+0080 to U+00FF)
- Latin Extended (U+0100 to U+024F)
- Greek and Coptic (U+0370 to U+03FF)
- Cyrillic (U+0400 to U+04FF)
- CJK Unified Ideographs (U+4E00 to U+9FFF)
- Various symbols and punctuation

#### Supplementary Planes (U+10000 to U+10FFFF)

- Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP, U+10000 to U+1FFFF)
- Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP, U+20000 to U+2FFFF)
- Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP, U+E0000 to U+EFFFF)
- Private Use Areas (PUA, U+F0000 to U+10FFFF)

## Test Implementation

### Generation Strategies

1. **Random Unicode Generation**:
   - Generate strings with random Unicode characters from different planes
   - Vary string length from very short (1-2 chars) to very long (10,000+ chars)
   - Mix characters from different planes in the same string

2. **Edge Case Generation**:
   - Generate strings with specific problematic sequences
   - Include surrogate pairs, combining characters, and zero-width characters
   - Test boundary conditions (first/last character in each plane)

3. **Invalid Sequence Testing**:
   - Generate strings with invalid UTF-8 sequences
   - Generate strings with unpaired UTF-16 surrogates
   - Test handling of overlong UTF-8 encodings

### Mutation Strategies

1. **Character Insertion**:
   - Insert Unicode characters at random positions in existing strings
   - Focus on inserting characters that might break parsing (quotes, control chars)

2. **Character Replacement**:
   - Replace ASCII characters with Unicode equivalents
   - Replace characters with combining character sequences

3. **Escape Sequence Manipulation**:
   - Convert characters to/from escape sequences
   - Create invalid escape sequences

## Expected Results

- **Parsing**: All valid Unicode strings should be parsed correctly
- **Serialization**: All Unicode characters should be serialized correctly
- **Round-trip**: All strings should survive a parse-serialize-parse round-trip
- **Error Handling**: Invalid sequences should be handled gracefully with appropriate errors
