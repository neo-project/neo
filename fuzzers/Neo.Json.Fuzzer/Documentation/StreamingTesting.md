# Streaming JSON Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the streaming JSON testing strategy for the Neo.Json.Fuzzer. Streaming JSON processing is essential for handling large JSON documents efficiently without loading the entire document into memory.

## Test Categories

### 1. Incremental Parsing

- Parsing JSON in chunks of varying sizes
- Parsing with incomplete data (requiring more input)
- Handling buffer boundaries that split tokens
- Resuming parsing after receiving more data

### 2. Stream Characteristics

- Very large JSON documents (>100MB)
- Deeply nested structures in streaming context
- Long arrays with thousands of elements
- Large string values spanning multiple chunks

### 3. Error Handling

- Malformed JSON in the middle of a stream
- Unexpected end of input
- Invalid tokens in streaming context
- Recovery after error conditions

### 4. Performance Characteristics

- Memory usage during streaming
- Processing time per character
- Throughput with different chunk sizes
- Comparison with non-streaming parsing

## Test Structure Generation

The fuzzer will generate JSON structures specifically designed to test streaming functionality:

1. **Large Arrays**: Arrays with thousands of simple elements
2. **Large Objects**: Objects with thousands of properties
3. **Deep Nesting**: Structures with deep nesting that challenge stack-based parsers
4. **Large String Values**: String values that exceed typical buffer sizes
5. **Mixed Content**: Combinations of the above patterns

## Streaming Simulation

The fuzzer will simulate streaming by:

1. Breaking valid JSON into chunks of varying sizes
2. Feeding chunks incrementally to the parser
3. Testing parser state between chunks
4. Introducing delays between chunks to simulate network conditions

## Coverage Goals

The streaming testing should aim to cover:

1. All token types in streaming context
2. Buffer boundary conditions
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Memory efficiency with large documents
5. Performance characteristics under different streaming conditions

## Implementation Approach

1. Create specialized large JSON generators
2. Implement a streaming simulation framework
3. Track parser state between chunks
4. Measure memory usage during streaming
5. Identify potential memory leaks or performance degradation
6. Test with both well-formed and malformed JSON

## Metrics to Collect

1. Memory usage per MB of input
2. Processing time per chunk
3. Token processing rate
4. Error recovery success rate
5. Maximum document size handled successfully
