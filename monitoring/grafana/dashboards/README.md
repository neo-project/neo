# Neo Node Dashboards for Grafana Alloy

This directory is maintained for reference purposes only. The actual dashboards are managed in Grafana Alloy cloud.

## Grafana Alloy Integration

Neo monitoring now uses Grafana Alloy for dashboard management, which provides:

1. Cloud-based persistent storage
2. Team sharing and collaboration 
3. Advanced visualization capabilities
4. Alerting and notification integrations

## Accessing Dashboards

To access the Neo dashboards:

1. Navigate to https://neo.grafana.net
2. Log in with your Grafana Cloud credentials
3. View the pre-configured Neo dashboards

## Dashboard Development

If you're developing new dashboards:

1. Create and test them in Grafana Alloy directly
2. Export the JSON definition if you need a local backup
3. DO NOT use local Grafana for production monitoring; use Grafana Alloy instead
